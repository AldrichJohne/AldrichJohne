ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AldrichJohne â€” a Software Engineer based in Ilocos Sur, Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­.

ðŸ’» I specialize in backend development using **Java (8/17)**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **REST APIs**, and **API Gateways (Apigee)**. Iâ€™ve worked on microservices, event-driven architectures, and cloud-native solutions at scale.
